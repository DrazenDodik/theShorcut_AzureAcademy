# Enrolling yourself to Future-Proof

>The Future-Proof.net portal is designed for Microsoft partner companies to develop their skills, get support from training companies and test their knowledge through practise tests.

1. Navigate to https://future-proof.net/
1. Scroll down to Microsoft Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900)
1. Click "[Enroll in this track](https://future-proof.net/microsoft-azure-fundamentals/enroll/)"

## Option to select paid additional services

You'll now be presented with additional options for support, buying a certificate of completion and getting yourself an AZ-900 exam voucher.

**Do not select any additional services!**

These options are offered, as the portal is originally designed for partner companies and those additional services might be relevant for them. In our case, we will just enroll to the free course.

Read the terms and conditions of the service, its quite short. Once you've ensured that the chckout total is 0€, accept the terms and place your order.

## Course view

You'll notice that this course contains the same topics that we've covered in our sessions previously. We enrolled to the same course from Future-Proof, just so you get access to the Final Exam, to test your knowledge and find any possible gaps you might have.

Go to the Final Exam -> Graded Final Exam and click on the "Assesment" link to start your exam.

>**NOTE:** This is not the official exam or the official paid practise exam, but a exam that our learning partner has designed to help you evaluate your skills.

Complete this exam. Based on the results you get, go back to the course contents that we've gone through in this course and brush up on your skills.

Once you feel ready to complete the certification, reach out to the Shortcut team for next steps.
